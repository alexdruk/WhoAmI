Chrome extension to screw profiling

Let’s face it: you are what Tech Giants collect on yours Internet activities. Forget about privacy. Year after year they analyze your personal data and transform it into a precious commodity. These companies then sell or distribute your data to a great number of other companies that can use it however they like. The trade-off between the data you give and the services you get may be worth it, but you can do nothing to stop Tech Giants from collecting information about you. 

However, you can provide them with false information that will mask your true identity. WhoAmI browser extension can help you in this “masquerade”. You can easily pretend to have different political affiliation, buying preferences, even sexual orientation. 

To activate extension open any web page and click on WhoAmI icon (right to the chrome search box). A new tab will open and your browser will start to visit predefined list of web sites masking your true identity. You can continue to surf the web in active tabs. Extension does not require your attention; it will work automatically as long as your browser is open. You can change this list by right clicking on the extension button, choosing Option and selecting parameters you like.

The source code is very simple so feel free to modify it!
